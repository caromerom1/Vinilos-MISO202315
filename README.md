## Execute App

To run the app follow these steps:

- Open the latest available version of Android Studio

- Select a device that uses Android SDK 21 or higher.

- Select `app` on the `Run / Debug Configurations` dropdown

- Click on `Run app` button

> Note: Take into account that the API is deployed on `render.com` so it is needed to wait until the API is running.
> If the API does not run at all, almost all the views will show an error after the loader stops.
> If after waiting a couple of minutes the API is not running (it happened to us a couple of times), please contact our member `Camilo Andrés Romero Maldonado` who owns the project of the API on render and can redeploy it.

## Execute Tests

To run the tests follow these steps:

- Open the latest available version of Android Studio

- Open any file containing tests

- Click on the button on the right side of the line number that matches the name of the class that contains tests
